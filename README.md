XMLEditor is a control for WPF-based applications and is written in C#.

To use, simply add the control to your WPF-based application and call the "LoadDocument" method. The element parameter will be the root. The location parameter will be where the document is saved when edited (just supply it with the original location to overwrite the old document). The level parameter is nothing you have to worry about; if level is 0 it will draw a line under each element to seperate it from the other.
